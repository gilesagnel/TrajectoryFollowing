# Trajectory Following Robot
The project aims to train a robot to navigate in unfamiliar indoor environments using minimal prior knowledge. The goal is for the robot to move from a starting point to an endpoint on a floor map image.
The approach involves computer vision and Deep Reinforcement Learning. The model is first trained in a simulated environment and then will be tested in the real world on a robot. Tools used include ROS, Gazebo, Python, MATLAB, Pytorch, and torchvision.
